# Data Science Assessment 2023–24

This repository contains my **Data Science Assessment ** project.  
The goal of this work is to perform **data loading, exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization** on the *Bank Records* dataset to identify meaningful insights and build an understanding of customer data patterns.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tunasisman/data-science-project.git
   cd data-science-project
   ```
2.	(Optional) Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
   # venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```
3.	Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn  
  ```
4.	Run the Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
  ```
Then open DATA Assessment 2023-24.ipynb and run the cells.

5.	(Alternative)
  To view results directly, open the exported HTML report:
  ```bash
  DATA Assessment 2023-24.html
  ```
## Key Insights & Findings
- Data Understanding: Explored attributes such as income, region, and demographic features.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and standardized features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized customer patterns, spending behaviors, and correlations.
- Conclusions: Identified key variables influencing banking activity and regional differences.
## Notes
-	Large data files (BankRecords.csv, BankRecords.db) were excluded from this repository due to size limitations.
